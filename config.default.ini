; dbus-aggregate-smartshunts Default Configuration
; ========================================================
; 
; DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
; 
; Copy settings you want to change to config.ini
; The config.ini file will override these defaults
; ========================================================
;
; QUICK START GUIDE - What to Configure
; ========================================================
; 
; MUST CONFIGURE (copy to config.ini):
;   (Nothing! By default acts as SmartShunt monitor, auto-detects capacity)
;
; RECOMMENDED TO REVIEW:
;   • DEVICE_NAME           - Custom name for how it appears in Venus OS
;
; USUALLY FINE AT DEFAULTS:
;   • Update intervals (device discovery backoff is automatic)
;   • Error handling (SEARCH_TRIALS, READ_TRIALS, TIME_BEFORE_RESTART)
;   • Logging settings
;
; Note: Voltage alarms (low/high) are automatically passed through from SmartShunts.
;       Configure voltage alarm thresholds in VictronConnect for each SmartShunt.
;
; ⚠️ IMPORTANT: BMS FUNCTIONALITY REMOVED
; This project is now PURE MONITORING ONLY (no charge control).
; For BMS functionality (CVL/CCL/DCL, AllowToCharge/Discharge), use:
;   → dbus-smartshunt-to-bms project instead
;
; ========================================================

; ----- Device Configuration -----
; Custom name for the aggregate device (how it appears in Venus OS)
; Leave empty for default "SmartShunt Aggregate"
; Example: DEVICE_NAME = Battery Bank
; Example: DEVICE_NAME = House Batteries
DEVICE_NAME = 

; ----- SmartShunt Configuration -----
; SmartShunts are now controlled via UI switches (Settings -> Switches panel)
; Discovery is enabled by default - all found SmartShunts are added as switches
; Toggle individual switches to enable/disable specific shunts from aggregation

; ----- Temperature Thresholds -----
; Temperature thresholds are now controlled via UI sliders (Settings -> Switches panel)
; Navigate to Settings -> Switches to configure:
;   • "Cold Limit" - Default: 50°F (10°C) - Reports coldest battery below this temp
;   • "Hot Limit" - Default: 105°F (40.5°C) - Reports hottest battery above this temp
; Adjust the sliders to set your desired thresholds
; Toggle the switch OFF to reset to defaults
; Between thresholds, the aggregate reports the average temperature

; ----- Capacity Detection -----
; Total capacity is automatically detected by reading the configured capacity from each SmartShunt
; (stored in VE.Direct register 0x1000). This is the capacity you set in VictronConnect.
; The aggregate sums the capacity from all included SmartShunts.
; No configuration needed - it always uses the values from your SmartShunts.

; ----- Device Discovery -----
; How often to check for new/missing SmartShunts

; Initial check interval (seconds) - used for first 30 seconds
; After startup, checks every second to quickly discover devices
UPDATE_INTERVAL_FIND_DEVICES = 1

; Maximum check interval (seconds) - after devices are stable
; Uses exponential backoff: 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → ... → 1800s (30 min)
; Reduces D-Bus traffic while still detecting new devices eventually
MAX_UPDATE_INTERVAL_FIND_DEVICES = 1800

; ----- Error Handling -----
; These control retry logic and service restart behavior

; Number of times to retry finding SmartShunts before giving up
SEARCH_TRIALS = 3

; Number of times to retry reading data from a SmartShunt before skipping it
READ_TRIALS = 3

; Seconds before restarting service after fatal error (0 = don't restart)
; The supervise daemon will restart the service automatically
TIME_BEFORE_RESTART = 0

; ----- Logging -----
; LOGGING levels: ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG
; ERROR   - only critical errors
; WARNING - errors and warnings
; INFO    - normal operation info (recommended)
; DEBUG   - detailed debugging (very verbose)
LOGGING = INFO

; How often to log a status summary (seconds)
; 0 = disable periodic logging (only log on changes/errors)
; 300 = log status every 5 minutes
; Periodic logs show current voltage, current, SoC for each shunt
LOG_PERIOD = 300

; EXAMPLE USER CONFIG (config.ini)

; Copy the settings below to config.ini and customize:
;
; [DEFAULT]
; ; Custom device name
; DEVICE_NAME = House Battery Bank
;
; ; Enable debug logging
; LOGGING = DEBUG
